<h4 style="color: brown;"> Types of French Fries </h4>
    <dl>
    <dt>Regular Fries</dt>
    <dd>These are the typical fries you think of first when you see the words “French fries” on any menu. They’re cut to a medium thickness (somewhere between 1/8- and 1/4-inch if you want to get specific) and deep-fried in a neutral-flavored oil with a high smoke point, like a vegetable, peanut or canola oil. Crispy on the outside, soft and fluffy in the middle and seasoned simply with salt, regular fries are the average of all other styles of fries, but when they’re done really well there’s nothing average about the amazing taste-texture combo they offer.</dd>
    <dt>Steak Fries</dt>
    <dd> It could be because the style of thick-cut fries is often served alongside steak, or because their slab-like shape somewhat resembles a steak. It doesnt really matter all you need to know is that steak fries are delicious, deep-fried to a crisp but with enough volume to promise soft, fluffy potato on the inside. Plus, their shape is great for dipping into ketchup or any other sauce of choice.</dd>
    <dt>Shoestring Fries</dt>
    <dd>Shoestring fries, as their name suggests, are long, very thin (less than 1/8 inch) and sometimes slightly curled. A tangled cluster of shoestring fries is a popular, tempting side dish that you need to eat quickly by the fork or fingerful – all that surface area means shoestrings get cold and soften quite quickly. It helps to have a mandolin or slicer attachment for a food processor if you want to fry your own shoestrings at home, although it’s certainly possible to cut them by hand too. Eat them at their peak just out of the fryer and you’ll be rewarded with a fantastic crispy texture unmatched by other types of French fries.</dd>
